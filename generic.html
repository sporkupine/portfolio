              My name is Connor Thompson, and I am a JavaScript/TypeScript developer 
              from Paducah, Kentucky. I am also the owner and manager of Paducah Coffee 
              Company, where I patiently endeavor in my endless quest to make the perfect 
              cup of coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey as a software developer began in college, near the beginning of the 
              Bitcoin craze. With a little help from my friends, I was convinced cryptocurrency 
              and blockchain technology would be the “next big thing,” and I set out to learn and 
              absorb everything I could. This led me very quickly to the basics of computer 
              science. Before I realized I was hooked, I had bought a couple of Udemy courses, 
              installed a virtual machine to run Linux on my school laptop, and dug up my old 
              Myspace page to remember anything I had ever learned about HTML (it wasn’t much, 
              but you have to start somewhere).
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward a year or so into the process of teaching myself software development 
              and computer science (primarily through the excellent resources at 
              <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> 
              and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a>), and I found myself stuck in a rut. I could code along with 
              tutorials, explain the basics of JavaScript, and build small front-end projects 
              for aesthetic and time-wasting purposes (you can see a couple of them 
              <a href="landing.html">here!</a> ), but I was without direction, rudderless in a 
              vast and overwhelming ocean of information.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was then that I stumbled across the CodeLabs full-stack developer training 
              program, being newly offered in my home town of Paducah. CodeLabs is an adult 
              education program provided by CodeFi and geared towards providing working adults 
              in rural areas like western Kentucky with the tools they need to transition into 
              software development jobs, and thereby attract more employers to the area. You can 
              read more about them <a href="https://www.codefiworks.com/codelabs/">here</a>. In the front-end portion of the CodeLabs program, 
                I have begun the process of mastering the Angular TypeScript framework. Learning 
                both a new framework and a new language simultaneously was challenging but 
                rewarding, and I now have all the tools of Angular 13 at my disposal to build 
                attractive, responsive, and useful web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next step in my journey will be the back-end portion of the CodeLabs program, 
              in which I will learn the fundamentals of server-side programming and master Ruby 
              on Rails. By April 2022, I will be a professional-level full-stack developer 
              looking to further my knowledge with new technologies and frameworks while seeking 
              opportunities to educate new programmers and develop the budding technology 
              industry of western Kentucky.
