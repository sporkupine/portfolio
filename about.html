              My name is Connor Thompson, and I'm a full-stack software
              developer from Kentucky. I am also the owner and CEO of
              Paducah Coffee Company, where I patiently endeavor in my endless
              quest to make the perfect cup of coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became interested in software while I was in college, when
              things like cryptocurrency and 3D printers were new in popular
              media. I wanted to understand more about how things worked, and
              quickly discovered I didn’t know much at all about computers.
              Armed with YouTube and Wikipedia, I set out to learn the basics of
              computer science. This led me to software development, and I began
              to learn the front end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I realized I was hooked, I had bought a couple of Udemy
              courses, installed a virtual machine to run Linux on my school
              laptop, and dug up my old Myspace page to remember anything I had
              ever learned about HTML (it wasn’t much, but you have to start
              somewhere).
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward two years or so into the process of teaching myself
              software development and computer science (primarily through the
              excellent resources at
              <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>
              and
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a>),
              and I found myself stuck in a rut. I could code along with
              tutorials, explain the basics of JavaScript, and build small
              front-end projects for aesthetic and time-wasting purposes (you
              can see a couple of them <a href="projects.html">here!</a> ), but
              I was without direction, rudderless in a vast and overwhelming
              ocean of information.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was then that I stumbled across the Code Labs full-stack
              developer training program, being newly offered in my home town of
              Paducah. Code Labs is an adult education program provided by
              CodeFi and geared towards providing working adults in rural areas
              like western Kentucky with the tools they need to transition into
              software development jobs, and thereby attract more employers to
              the area. You can read more about them
              <a href="https://www.codefiworks.com/codelabs/">here</a>. In the
              front-end portion of the Code Labs program, I started the process
              of mastering the Angular TypeScript framework. Learning both a new
              framework and a new language simultaneously was challenging but
              rewarding, and I now have all the tools of Angular 13 at my
              disposal to build attractive, responsive, and useful web
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January of 2022, I moved on from the front-end program offered
              by Code Labs to the back-end, and began learning Ruby on Rails. I
              really enjoy working in Ruby as it has a very intuitive syntax,
              and reads more like English, which makes reading code much faster.
              The Rails framework makes building web applications efficient and
              simple, and rounds out my toolbox as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the Code Labs program, I have also gained real work
              experience in software development, working with the development
              team at CodeFi on the website for the
              <a href="https://www.youthcodingleague.com/"
                >Youth Coding League</a
              >. I worked with a Project Manager, a designer, and a developer to
              implement a complete redesign and refactor of their existing
              production website. This experience is invaluable to me, as it has
              prepared me for professional development work in a real-world
              setting and established a baseline of experience for future
              employment.
