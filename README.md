FInishing work on a new portfolio site
---
## To Do:
- update links on Projects page
- update images to screenshots of the projects
  - probably freshen up the older projects a bit first
  - also get everything hosted and running, link to hosted site with an additional link to the GitHub repos
- link Contact form to actually contact me
  - maybe enable a reCaptcha to prevent spam
- get a second opinion on About Me page
  - too much text?
- add picture of me to About Me page, replace current blank image
