FInishing work on a new portfolio site
---
## To Do:
- update links on Projects page
  - everything but PCC is good to go, PCC is not hosted yet.
- update images to screenshots of the projects
  - probably freshen up the older projects a bit first
  - Recipe App needs a css makeover
  - get PCC hosted, everything else is ready
- link Contact form to actually contact me
  - maybe enable a reCaptcha to prevent spam
- add picture of me to About Me page, replace current blank image
